"a state of mystical reverie incepted by vast abscenses." _(notes from the library)_

"Spirit Meadow is sometimes described as a four sided field bounded by the states of sleeping, waking, dreaming, and trance; it is simultaneously considered a place of embodied power and an actual place... serves as both a state of orientation for the dreamer and also the fecundated locus that gives birth to dreams themselves."

notes from _Veneficium_ by Daniel A. Schulke

detail  _spirit meadow_ 2020. weaving. 32"x 88" silk, wool, cotton, linen

the topography of dreamscape, worship, labor.  
vivid, scented, sacred.  
a tangle of feast and famine.  
a source of both delerium and ecstasy.  
"a place that is not a place"  
a pharmacopeia of possibility.  
flight.  
visions.  
dying.  
undying.
