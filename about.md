Half Hidden is a secret garden, expanding library, artist studio, and gathering space for a variety of esoteric and creative intentions. Beneath it's main street facing 70s facade lies an 1860s structure recently renovated with the hope of encouraging and growing more interdependent communities engaged in creative thinking, listening, and being.
